    <p><i>"It is thus not the lack of cleanliness or health that causes abjection but what disturbs identity, system,
            and
            order. What does not respect borders, positions, rules. The in-between, the ambiguous, the composite." -
            (Kristeva, Powers of Horror)</i></p>
    <p>--------------------------------------------- </p>
    <p class="last-text"><a href="https://jellymeat.info/" target="_blank">JELLYMEAT</a> examines Kristeva’s concept of
        the abject through
        the lens of technology and AI, envisioning a
        fictional world of machine-meat hybrid beings endowed with extraordinary intelligence and emotional depth—yet
        constrained by a fatal flaw: a lifespan of just 12 hours.</p>

    <p>--------------------------------------------- <i>The Process</i></p>
    <p>Each character was uniquely generated using Stable Diffusion XL, fine-tuned with a LoRA
        trained on images of
        transparent electronics and cellular structures. This visual dataset was then integrated into ChatGPT, which was
        prompted to generate "a day in the life" narratives for each Jellymeat, informed by distinct traits and
        personalities. The resulting characters were compiled into a custom-built website coded in HTML.</p>
    <p>--------------------------------------------- <i>Next Steps</i></p>
    <p>This project remains ongoing. The next iteration involves developing a bespoke model to generate text that echoes
        the intricate and poetic absurdity of OpenAI’s original Davinci model, aiming to further enrich the
        individuality and depth of each character.</p>
