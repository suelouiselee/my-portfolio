    <h1>Koreatown Plaza</h1>
    <p><a href="/index.html">Home</a> | <a href="projects.html">Back to Projects</a></p>

    <p>The space that I chose to model is the Koreatown Plaza, a shopping mall located in Koreatown, Los Angeles. It
        first opened in 1988 as the first major indoor shopping center in Koreatown. I have memories of going there
        every Sunday after church to go grocery shopping with my family and if I got lucky, go to Artbox and grow my
        food eraser collection. The mall is straight out of the 80s and holds no semblance to malls in South Korea, and
        today, the stores are mostly empty and receive little foot traffic. This project gave me the opportunity to
        explore the Koreatown Plaza in the context of a liminal space and the absence of performance and ritual.</p>
