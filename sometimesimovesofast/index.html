    <p>A state of limbo emerges when the speed of our environment is out of sync with our perception of it. In it exists
        flux and perpetual transformation. The paradox is that it also creates a perpetual present that can consume you.
        We can easily become lost, and vanish in the endless flow of information we call experience.</p>

    <p class="last-text">The audio element is a compilation of AI-generated statements of empathy and rhythmic markers
        that acts as a
        sensory deprivation instrument; phrases become disjointed in the process, inducing a meditative state of
        drifting off. The interactive element uses motion detection to alter and challenge the coherence of one's
        physical image, bringing attention to the role motion plays in our understanding of time and harmony with the
        external world.</p>
